# hello-world
This is my first repostory
My name is Paul Lendo Riebe. I´m new in the programming thing, but i want to learn.
I began with learning Python and Arduino and I look forward to learn way more.
I´m a member of the CCC in Essen (very nice there) and a Friend told me abot this place.
I´m hoping for some good advice in my future projects and to learn something new.
